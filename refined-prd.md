## **1. Product Vision & Strategy**

### **1.1. Vision**

To become the leading comprehensive EdTech platform that empowers students, tutors, and educational institutions with a synergistic ecosystem of AI-driven tools, a thriving tutor marketplace, and powerful administrative controls. We aim to provide a responsible, effective, and personalized learning experience for all users.

### **1.2. Problem Statement**

Students worldwide face high-stakes exams with inadequate and impersonal tools. Tutors lack a dedicated platform to connect with students and manage their business. Educational institutions struggle to integrate effective EdTech solutions that provide meaningful oversight and analytics. The current market is fragmented, with separate solutions for AI tutoring, tutor marketplaces, and learning management, creating a disjointed experience for all stakeholders.

- **For Students:** An AI-powered exam coach that provides personalized learning paths, detailed analytics, and access to a marketplace of qualified tutors.
- **For Tutors:** A full-featured marketplace to build their brand, connect with students, manage scheduling and payments, and grow their business.
- **For Institutions & Admins:** A powerful administrative panel to manage users, oversee academic progress, and gain insights into the learning process.
