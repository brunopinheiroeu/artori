## 16. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### How do I manage user permissions and roles?

The Artori platform uses a role-based access control system with three distinct user roles, each with specific capabilities and limitations:

#### Student Role Capabilities

- **Access:** Can access the main learning platform and practice exams
- **Exam Management:** Can view and take available exams and practice sessions
- **Progress Tracking:** Can view their own progress, scores, and study history
- **Profile Management:** Can update their own profile information and preferences
- **Limitations:** Cannot access admin panel, cannot view other users' data, cannot modify exam content

#### Admin Role Capabilities

- **Access:** Full access to admin panel with most administrative functions
- **Exam Management:** Can create, edit, and delete exams, subjects, and questions
- **User Management:** Can view all user accounts and their progress data
- **Analytics:** Can access comprehensive analytics and generate reports
- **Dashboard:** Can view system metrics, activity feeds, and performance data
- **Limitations:** Cannot access system settings, cannot manage other admin accounts, cannot perform super admin functions

#### Super Admin Role Capabilities

- **Access:** Complete system access with all administrative privileges
- **User Management:** Can create, edit, and delete all user accounts including other admins
- **System Settings:** Can modify system configuration, security settings, and platform preferences
- **Database Management:** Can access backup settings, maintenance schedules, and system health monitoring
- **Security Management:** Can configure authentication policies, session management, and security features
- **Full Control:** Can perform all admin functions plus system-level management and configuration

#### Role Assignment and Management

- User roles are assigned during account creation or can be modified by Super Admins
- Role changes take effect immediately upon update
- Each role has specific API endpoint access permissions enforced at the backend level
- Role-based UI elements ensure users only see features they have permission to use

For detailed permission matrices and specific feature access, refer to Section 7.1 (Role-Based Access Control) of this document.
