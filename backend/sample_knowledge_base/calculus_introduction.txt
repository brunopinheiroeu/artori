    Introduction to Calculus

    Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change and accumulation of quantities.
    It has two main branches: differential calculus and integral calculus.

    Differential Calculus:
    - Studies rates of change and slopes of curves
    - Key concept: the derivative
    - Applications: optimization, motion analysis, marginal analysis

    Integral Calculus:
    - Studies accumulation of quantities and areas under curves
    - Key concept: the integral
    - Applications: area calculation, volume calculation, probability

    The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus connects these two branches, showing that
    differentiation and integration are inverse operations.

    Key Formulas:
    - Derivative of x^n: nx^(n-1)
    - Integral of x^n: x^(n+1)/(n+1) + C
    - Chain rule: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) Ã— g'(x)
