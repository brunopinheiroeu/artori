      "question": "What is Newton's Second Law of Motion?",
      "explanation": "Newton's Second Law states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. The formula is F = ma, where F is force, m is mass, and a is acceleration.",
      "concept": "Force and acceleration relationship",
      "applications": [
        "Calculating force needed to accelerate a car",
        "Understanding why heavier objects need more force to accelerate",
        "Analyzing motion in sports and engineering"
      ]

    {
      "question": "How do you calculate kinetic energy?",
      "explanation": "Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. It's calculated using the formula KE = ½mv², where m is mass and v is velocity. The energy increases with the square of velocity.",
      "concept": "Energy and motion",
      "examples": [
        "A 2kg ball moving at 5 m/s has KE = ½(2)(5²) = 25 J",
        "Doubling speed quadruples kinetic energy",
        "Used in collision analysis and energy conservation"
