      "question": "What is the solution to the equation 2x + 5 = 13?",
      "explanation": "To solve 2x + 5 = 13, we need to isolate x. First, subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 8. Then divide both sides by 2: x = 4.",
      "concept": "Linear equations and algebraic manipulation",
      "steps": [
        "Start with the equation: 2x + 5 = 13",
        "Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 13 - 5 = 8",
        "Divide both sides by 2: x = 8/2 = 4",
        "Verify: 2(4) + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13 ✓"

      "question": "How do you factor x² - 5x + 6?",
      "explanation": "To factor x² - 5x + 6, we need to find two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to -5. These numbers are -2 and -3. So x² - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3).",

        "Write as factors: (x - 2)(x - 3)",
        "Verify: (x - 2)(x - 3) = x² - 3x - 2x + 6 = x² - 5x + 6 ✓"
